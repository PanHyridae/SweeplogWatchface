Sweeplog- A simple analog watch face with a sweeping animation. A clasic look for the modern era.

Sweeplog is a simple and easy to use watch face for Android Wear. This includes an analog watch face that has a sweeping motion on the seconds hand. I have made this open source so other developers can learn from it and so I can learn from other developers. Feel free to use this but please respect the following requirements:

1. Credit both me and Google (as this is made from the watch face sample) in either the app itself or in the description of the app or Repo. 
2. Please respect the license below.
3. Please do not use the same name as me. 
4. Have fun with it! :)
